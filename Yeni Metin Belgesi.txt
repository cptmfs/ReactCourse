2. Network Formation
A software development company is working to create several shared computing systems throughout an office.

 

For computers to be on the same network, there are the following constraints:

They must be adjacent to one another.
There must be a minimum number of computers.
The total processing speed of the network (the sum of each computer's processing speed) must be at least a certain threshold.
A computer can only belong to one network.
 

Given the processing speeds and order of the computers, as well as the network constraints, determine the maximum number of networks that can be formed.

 

Example

n = 6

speed = [5, 7, 9, 12, 10, 13]

minComps = 2 

speedThreshold = 15

 

There are n = 6 computers. Each network needs to have a minimum of minComps = 2 computers and a total processing speed of at least speedThreshold = 15.

The first network includes the second, third, and fourth computers, which results in a total processing speed of 7+9+12 = 28. This is above the threshold of 15.
The second network includes the fifth and sixth computers, with a total processing speed of 10+13 = 23.
 

The maximum number of networks that can be formed is 2.

 

Function Description

Complete the function maximumNetworks in the editor.

 

maximumNetworks has the following parameter(s):

    int speed[n]:  speed[i] denotes the processing speed of the ith computer

    int minComps: the minimum number of computers each network must have

    long speedThreshold: the minimum total processing speed a network must have

 

Returns

    int: the maximum number of networks that can be formed from the computers

 

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 105

1 ≤ speed[i] ≤ 109

1 ≤ minComps ≤ n

1 ≤ speedThreshold ≤ 1014

Explanation

 

One of the optimal ways to form the networks is to use the third and fourth computers to form the first network, and the last three computers to form the second network. Both the networks have at least minComps = 2 computers in them and a total processing speed of (2+5) = 7 and (3+2+4) = 9, which are not below the threshold value.




int networkCount = 0;
        int computerCount = 0;
        long totalSpeed = 0;

        foreach (int s in speed)
        {
            computerCount++;
            totalSpeed += s;

            if (computerCount >= minComps && totalSpeed >= speedThreshold)
            {
                networkCount++;
                computerCount = 0;
                totalSpeed = 0;
            }
        }

        return networkCount;




The first line contains an integer, n, the size of speed.

Each of the next i lines contains an integer, speed[i].

The next line contains an integer, minComps.

The next line contains an integer, speedThreshold.
